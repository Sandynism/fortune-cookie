# Fortune Cookie

## How to Use the App
For information on how to install our app on Slack or how to use it via email & web instead, check out [our website](https://fortune-cookie-bot.herokuapp.com).

## Project Details
This project was coded for the Columbia Full Stack Web Development Coding Bootcamp by [Sandy Yeung](), [Evan Ross](), [Julia Macalaster](), and [Kenneth Postigo]().

## Technologies
- Although we wanted to focus on user-generated fortunes, we did use the [Fortune Cookie API](http://fortunecookieapi.herokuapp.com/) for their handy "Learn Chinese" lessons which a user may randomly receive, if they're lucky!

## Credits
- Fortune cookie icon from [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/fortune-cookie_284776).
